## A thankful moment

Today I had the privilege of receiving that beautiful crystal tower with the 2025 year disc — the Microsoft Most Valuable Professional award. I’m humbled and grateful for this recognition and for the people who made this journey meaningful.

This recognition reinforces my commitment to keep sharing what I learn—openly, honestly and with practical real‑world code. It gives me fresh energy to continue speaking, running workshops and writing. It’s a powerful reminder that communities grow strongest when we teach, listen and build together.

I’m deeply grateful to my family for their unfailing support behind the scenes. Your encouragement made this possible.
I want to extend my heartfelt thanks to [Nico Orschel](https://www.linkedin.com/in/nico-orschel/) for being a trusted mentor and for the nomination—your support has been instrumental in this journey. Also, a big thank you to [Thomas Tomow](https://www.linkedin.com/in/thomas-tomow-963850111/) for supporting this throughout my time at Xebia; your guidance has helped shape my path in ways I deeply appreciate.

Thanks for being part of this journey. Let’s keep building and learning together.
Let’s keep doing epic shit together!
