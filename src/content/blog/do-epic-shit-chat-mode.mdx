## Turning GitHub Copilot Chat Into "Beast Mode"

In my previous article on [custom chat modes](/posts/github-copilot-custom-chat-modes) I showed how specialized modes focus Copilot. Today we go one step further: designing a so‑called **"Beast Mode"**—a maximal autonomy configuration for deep, multi‑step problem solving—then comparing it to my own **Do Epic Shit Chat Mode**.

## What Is "Beast Mode" Conceptually?

"Beast Mode" (not an official VS Code name) is a pattern for an **aggressively proactive Copilot Chat configuration** that:

1. Grants broad tool surface (codebase, search, usages, tests, tasks, terminals, fetch, repo introspection).
2. Enforces a **strict iterative TODO loop** before yielding control.
3. Requires **fresh validation / research** instead of relying on model memory.
4. Encourages **recursive expansion** (follow links, fetch more docs) until coverage is high.
5. Mandates **post‑action verification**: run tests, lint, or inspect artifacts.

It is best for non‑trivial refactors, exploratory debugging, orchestration across multiple subsystems, or generating first drafts of multi‑file features. The label is community vernacular (informal; not in official docs) for a _high‑discipline autonomous_ Copilot Chat configuration rather than an official feature.

## The Do Epic Shit Mode File (Highlights)

Key traits from the linked `epicshit.chatmode.md`:

- Frontmatter description: versioned ("4.1 Do Epic Shit Mode v1.4") signalling iterative hardening.
- Wide tool array: `changes`, `codebase`, `editFiles`, `runTasks`, `runTests`, `terminalLastCommand`, `searchResults`, `vscodeAPI`, `github`—> maximizes observable + actionable surface.
- Model pinned: `GPT-4.1` (explicit stability / capability expectation).
- **Checklist format contract**: exact markdown pattern required, forbidding HTML → predictable parsing for future automation.
- Explicit autonomy rule: _"do not end your turn until everything is truly complete"_ → prevents premature handoff.
- Embedded operational doctrine: deep research, recursive exploration, reflection between steps, exhaustive verification.

## Beast Mode vs Do Epic Shit Mode

| Capability       | Generic "Beast Mode" Pattern | Do Epic Shit Mode                                                   | Advantage                        |
| ---------------- | ---------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------- |
| Tool Scope       | Broad, but conceptual        | Exhaustively enumerated, including diagnostics & test failure tools | Concrete reproducibility         |
| Iteration Loop   | Encouraged                   | Hard requirement (no early exit)                                    | Guarantees completion discipline |
| Research Mandate | Often implied                | Explicit recursive fetch & validation                               | Reduces stale assumptions        |
| Versioning       | Optional                     | Version tag in description                                          | Traceability & evolution         |
| Verification     | Recommended                  | Mandatory (tests, edges)                                            | Higher confidence output         |
| Tool Governance  | Loose                        | Curated list avoiding ambiguity                                     | Predictable environment          |

The **Do Epic Shit Mode** operationalizes the abstract Beast Mode idea into a **repeatable, enforceable contract** that an agent must follow, which is the real differentiator.

## Why This Matters

Without a structured autonomy contract, large edits risk:

- Early termination leaving hidden TODOs
- Unverified assumptions about external APIs
- Shallow research (first‑page bias)
- Undocumented decision paths

The mode bakes safeguards directly into the interaction layer.

## New VS Code Chat Settings & How They Differ

Recent settings surfaced in your editor configuration (see the official [Copilot Chat docs](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/copilot/copilot-chat) and [Copilot configuration overview](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/copilot/overview#_configure-copilot), plus the [VS Code release notes](https://code.visualstudio.com/updates) for experimental flags):

```jsonc
"chat.todoListTool.enabled": true,
"github.copilot.chat.alternateGptPrompt.enabled": true
```

How they relate:

| Setting                                          | What It Does                                                             | Relation to Mode's Internal TODO Contract                                                            |
| ------------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------------ | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `chat.todoListTool.enabled`                      | Enables native structured TODO extraction / management in Chat           | Complements the mode: built‑in tracking can observe the **markdown checklist** the mode enforces     |
| `github.copilot.chat.alternateGptPrompt.enabled` | Switches to an alternative system prompt (often more reasoning‑oriented) | Stacks with the mode’s own instructions; alternate base prompt + mode overlay yields deeper planning |

Difference vs in‑file checklist instruction: **The mode hard‑codes the REQUIRED checklist format; the VS Code TODO feature is optional infrastructure.** If the checklist deviates, the mode becomes invalid regardless of the tool’s capability. The tool can _assist_, not _define_, the contract.

## Designing Your Own High‑Discipline Mode

When forking or extending:

1. Keep the **format spec minimal & strict** (single source of parsing truth).
2. Explicitly list _every_ tool—avoid implicit defaults so changes are intentional.
3. Add a short **version note** in description for auditability.
4. Require **reflection after each step** (prevents autopilot drift).
5. Gate exit on: checklist empty + tests pass (if test suite exists) + lint clean.

### Minimal Template Example

```markdown
---
description: "Beast Mode v0.1"
tools: ["codebase", "search", "runTests", "runTasks", "terminal", "editFiles"]
model: GPT-4.1
---

You are an autonomous engineering agent. Follow the checklist until all items are completed & verified.

Checklist format:

- [ ] Step 1: ...
- [ ] Step 2: ...
```

## Conclusion

The **Do Epic Shit Chat Mode** transforms the aspirational idea of a Copilot "Beast Mode" into a _codified operational framework_—mixing wide tool access, rigid checklist grammar, recursive research, and verification discipline. With the new VS Code chat settings assisting (native TODO parsing + alternative base prompt), the mode remains the _source of truth_ for process governance.

Iterate responsibly: measure value (fewer regressions, faster feature completion) and keep versioning the mode as you refine its rules.
