## Turning GitHub Copilot Chat Into "Beast Mode"

In my previous article on [custom chat modes](/posts/github-copilot-custom-chat-modes) I showed how specialized modes focus Copilot.
Today we go one step further: designing a so-called **"Beast Mode"**, a maximal autonomy configuration for deep, multi-step problem solving.

<Hint type="info">
  Credit: the initial version of the **Do Epic Shit Mode** was refined with help
  from [@kasuken](https://github.com/kasuken). The live file:
  [epicshit.chatmode.md](https://github.com/harrybin/gh-copilot/blob/main/.github/chatmodes/epicshit.chatmode.md).
</Hint>

## What Is "Beast Mode" Conceptually?

"Beast Mode" (not an official VS Code name) is a pattern for an **aggressively proactive Copilot Chat configuration** that:

1. Grants broad tool surface (codebase, search, usages, tests, tasks, terminals, fetch, repo introspection).
2. Enforces a **strict iterative TODO loop** before yielding control.
3. Requires **fresh validation / research** instead of relying on model memory.
4. Encourages **recursive expansion** (follow links, fetch more docs) until coverage is high.
5. Mandates **post-action verification**: run tests, lint, or inspect artifacts.

It is best for non-trivial refactors, exploratory debugging, orchestration across multiple subsystems, or generating first drafts of multi-file features.

### Why Was "Beast Mode" Created?

Community iterations (see also [“Beast Mode v3 is here”](https://www.reddit.com/r/GithubCopilot/comments/1lv4guq/beast_mode_v3_is_here/)) emerged to solve recurring pain points.
Another goal: bring Copilot’s default (currently GPT-4.1) closer to the “persistent reasoning depth” people appreciate in Claude Sonnet without burning premium requests
and additionally to mitigate:

1. **Premature agent exit** – Default flows stop after surface answers; strict checklists enforce completion.
2. **Shallow research** – Prompts sometimes lean on stale internal knowledge; recursive fetch rules force live validation.
3. **Hidden partial edits** – Multi-file changes risk inconsistencies; mandated verification (tests / lint) reduces drift.
4. **Unstructured planning** – Ad hoc steps reduce traceability; a canonical markdown checklist becomes an auditable log.
5. **Tool over/under-use** – Either terminal spam or neglect; curated tool lists create balanced, intentional capability.
6. **Untracked evolution** – Version tagging (v1, v2, v3…) allows empirical comparison of behavior changes.

These drivers shaped the norms later embodied and extended in more disciplined variants.

## The Do Epic Shit Mode

This pattern inspired my colleague [@kasuken](https://github.com/kasuken) and me to create our own version: the **Do Epic Shit Mode**—a hardened, opinionated realization of the Beast Mode idea.

## The Do Epic Shit Mode File (Highlights)

Key traits from `epicshit.chatmode.md`:

- Frontmatter description: versioned ("4.1 Do Epic Shit Mode v1.4") signalling iterative hardening.
- Wide tool array: `changes`, `codebase`, `editFiles`, `runTasks`, `runTests`, `terminalLastCommand`, `searchResults`, `vscodeAPI`, `github`—> maximizes observable + actionable surface.
- Model pinned: `GPT-4.1` (explicit stability / capability expectation).
- **Checklist format contract**: exact markdown pattern required, forbidding HTML → predictable parsing for future automation.
- Explicit autonomy rule: _"do not end your turn until everything is truly complete"_ → prevents premature handoff.
- Embedded operational doctrine: deep research, recursive exploration, reflection between steps, exhaustive verification.

## Beast Mode vs Do Epic Shit Mode

| Capability       | Generic "Beast Mode" Pattern | Do Epic Shit Mode                                                   | Advantage                        |
| ---------------- | ---------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------- |
| Tool Scope       | Broad, but conceptual        | Exhaustively enumerated, including diagnostics & test failure tools | Concrete reproducibility         |
| Iteration Loop   | Encouraged                   | Hard requirement (no early exit)                                    | Guarantees completion discipline |
| Research Mandate | Often implied                | Explicit recursive fetch & validation                               | Reduces stale assumptions        |
| Versioning       | Optional                     | Version tag in description                                          | Traceability & evolution         |
| Verification     | Recommended                  | Mandatory (tests, edges)                                            | Higher confidence output         |
| Tool Governance  | Loose                        | Curated list avoiding ambiguity                                     | Predictable environment          |

The **Do Epic Shit Mode** is more persistent and less lasse aggressive at some point and gives you more control over the behavior of the agent because you modify it to your needs.

## Why This Matters

Without a structured autonomy contract, large edits risk:

- Early termination leaving hidden TODOs
- Unverified assumptions about external APIs
- Shallow research (first-page bias)
- Undocumented decision paths

The mode bakes safeguards directly into the interaction layer.

## New VS Code Chat Settings & How They Differ

Recent settings surfaced in your editor configuration (see the official [Copilot Chat docs](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/copilot/copilot-chat),
[Copilot configuration overview](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/copilot/overview#_configure-copilot), plus [VS Code release notes](https://code.visualstudio.com/updates)):

```jsonc
"chat.todoListTool.enabled": true,
"github.copilot.chat.alternateGptPrompt.enabled": true
```

How they relate:

| Setting                                          | What It Does                                                             | Relation to Mode's Internal TODO Contract                                                          |
| ------------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------------ | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `chat.todoListTool.enabled`                      | Enables native structured TODO extraction / management in Chat           | Complements the mode: native tracking observes the **markdown checklist** the mode enforces        |
| `github.copilot.chat.alternateGptPrompt.enabled` | Switches to an alternative system prompt (often more reasoning-oriented) | Stacks with the mode: alternate base prompt + mode overlay → deeper planning & redundancy in rigor |

Difference vs in-file checklist instruction: **The mode hard-codes the REQUIRED checklist format; VS Code’s TODO feature is optional infrastructure.**
If the checklist deviates, the mode becomes invalid regardless of tool assistance.

## Designing Your Own High-Discipline Mode

When forking or extending:

1. Keep the **format spec minimal & strict** (single source of parsing truth).
2. Explicitly list _every_ tool—avoid implicit defaults so changes are intentional.
3. Add a short **version note** in description for auditability.
4. Require **reflection after each step** (prevents autopilot drift).
5. Gate exit on: checklist empty + tests pass (if test suite exists) + lint clean.

### Minimal Template Example

```markdown
---
description: "Beast Mode v0.1"
tools: ["codebase", "search", "runTests", "runTasks", "terminal", "editFiles"]
model: GPT-4.1
---

You are an autonomous engineering agent. Follow the checklist until all items are completed & verified.

Checklist format:

- [ ] Step 1: ...
- [ ] Step 2: ...
```

## Conclusion

The **Do Epic Shit Chat Mode** turns an aspirational “Beast Mode” notion into a **codified operational framework**:
wide tool access, rigid checklist grammar, recursive research, and verification discipline. With new VS Code chat settings assisting (native TODO parsing + alternate base prompt),
the mode itself remains the authoritative governance layer.

**Key takeaways:**

- Codify autonomy; don’t rely on model goodwill.
- Enforce deterministic checklist grammar.
- Treat research as a loop, not a single fetch.
- Version your mode—make evolution observable.
- Verification gates prevent “looks done” drift.
